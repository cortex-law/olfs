# Open Legal Field Standard (OLFS)

OLFS is a standardized taxonomy for legal document fields. It is designed to streamline legal document drafting by automating data mapping, improving efficiency, and promoting interoperability among legal tech tools.

*Disclaimer* Please be aware that the Open Legal Field Standard (OLFS) is still in active development. While we are making every effort to maintain stability, changes are to be expected. As such, we recommend using OLFS for experimental or development purposes until we release a stable version.

We appreciate all feedback and contributions that will help us improve and finalize the standard.

## Getting Started

The `schema/` directory contains the OLFS taxonomy itself. The YAML files can be used to generate code, validate data, and well as serve as documentation for the fields themselves. Each subdirectory represents a category of the taxonomy with relevant schema files. Review these files to understand the structure and details of the taxonomy.

## Usage

The `examples/` directory provides examples of the taxonomy in use. These examples are a good starting point for understanding how you could implement the OLFS in your projects.

In the `docs/` directory, you'll find comprehensive documentation on how to use the OLFS, including detailed guidelines and FAQs.

## Contributing

We invite and welcome contributions to the OLFS project! Whether you're improving existing schemas, adding new ones, fixing bugs, or enhancing documentation, your contribution is valuable.
